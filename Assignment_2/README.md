## Retriever

A retriever is a component in natural language processing systems designed to fetch relevant information or documents from a large corpus based on a given query. It is commonly used in tasks like information retrieval, question answering, and search engines.

### Code Methods for Retriever

#### 1. `retrieve_documents(query: str) -> List[str]`
This method takes a query as input and returns a list of relevant documents from the corpus. It uses similarity measures to rank documents based on their relevance to the query.

#### 2. `preprocess_query(query: str) -> str`
This method preprocesses the input query by tokenizing, removing stop words, and applying stemming or lemmatization to improve retrieval accuracy.

#### 3. `rank_documents(documents: List[str], query: str) -> List[str]`
This method ranks the retrieved documents based on their relevance to the query using scoring algorithms like TF-IDF or BM25.

#### 4. `load_corpus(corpus_path: str) -> None`
This method loads the corpus from the specified path into memory, preparing it for retrieval operations.

#### 5. `evaluate_retriever(test_queries: List[str], ground_truth: List[List[str]]) -> float`
This method evaluates the retriever's performance using metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score by comparing retrieved results with ground truth data.
